# Traffic-Sign-Classifier-Project2
This project is an implementation of LeNet ConvNet that takes 32 x 32 x RGB images of German Traffic Sign, as input. Each image undergoes a set of algorithms for preprocessing, then is run through my own implementation of LeNet ConvNet determining and labeling each Traffic Sign fed into the network with an accuracy of 93.5 %
